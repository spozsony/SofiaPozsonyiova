<p>Daggity is an awesome online tool that I recently learned about that helps you simplify the causal discovery process. That said, this semester I created a DAG to understand the affect of comprehensive education on adolescent sexual activity. Specifically, I was looking at if schools that include comprehensive sex education courses have higher rates of sexually active adolescents? My DAG is the initial step in my causal discovery process and highlights some of the potential confounders and mediators that might arise in the actual study.</p>
